# dapp-template

This project was bootstrapped with [Create Vite](https://github.com/vitejs/vite/tree/main/packages/create-vite).

## Development

### pnpm

This project uses [pnpm](https://pnpm.io/) as a package manager. In many of our repositories we use a monorepo approach. The optimal solution for this approach is to use `pnpm`. It is faster than `npm` and consumes less disk storage than `yarn`.

#### Install

To install pnpm with Homebrew run `brew install pnpm`, for other installation options
please see the [documentation](https://pnpm.io/installation).

#### Quickstart

Install dependencies and start the dApp:

```bash
   pnpm install
   pnpm run start
```
